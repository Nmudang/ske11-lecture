# New Thoughts & Creative Thinking

Engineers use logical & rational thinking more than creative thinking.

## Creative Thinking

Creative thinking involves these attributes

- Curiosity
- Openness to novelty
- Reasoning by methaphor & analogy
- Invention
- Imagination
- Playfulness
- Idea generation

### Creativity myth

1. The 1st creativity myth: Only artists (designers, art directors, performers, writers, novelists, etc) can be creative
  - Creativity is much broader and more universal
2. Instant judgement is the enemy of creativity, so we have to suspend, deter, or delay judgement in order to be creative.
3. Creativity is thinking outside the box
   - Facing some constraints to your thinking can help your thinking

### How to make yourself a creative thinker

1. Be a curious person
2. Try De Bono's six thinking hats
3. Try divergent thinking: flexible attention as opposed to constant concentration
   -  Take a shower, take a walk, nap, etc
4. Try convergent thinking: focused kind of creativity (eg. solving algebra questions)
5. Try using more metaphor in your work
   - Combine two simpler ideas to form a more complex idea
   - Bridge two ideas that are not equivalent by trying to detect things that the two have in common
6. Try reasoning by analogy
8. Try using other possible-world thinking (thought experiments)
9. CRAP (Compound Remote Associate Problem)
10. Try using your emotions more
   - Empathy
   - Perspectival thinking
   - Situated thinking
11. Learn from improvisation
