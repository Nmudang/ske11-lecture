- Family can be two or more adult siblings who live together, a parent and child, two adults who are married but have no children, or an adult with adopted child.
- According to George Murdock, family is "a social group characterized by common residence, economic cooperation and reproduction. It includes adults of both sexes, at least two of whom maintain a socially approved sexual relationship, and one or more children, own or adopted, of the sexually cohabiting adults."
