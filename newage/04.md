# Everyday life information management

## Personal information management

Personal information are:

- Email
- Social
- Money
- Work

We can apply Marie Kondo's concepts to home organization to these

1. Make a decision to organize your home
2. Visualize ideal life style
3. Start from discarding (and be thankful)
4. Keep only things that "spark joy"
5. Organize by "category", not location
6. Organize in the right order

## Email

Rules for emailing (from Eric Schmidt)

1. Respond quickly
2. Short email
3. Clean your inbox
4. Handle newest email first
5. Forward email to interested people
6. Avoid BCC
7. Don't yell
8. Make it easy to follow up on requests
9. Forward email to yourself with search keywords

We learned about how to setup forwarding for KU, GMail, how to setup sending address in GMail, how to setup GMail labels

Assignment: Cleanup your inbox to have at most 20 emails

## Social network

We learned how to put people in Facebook into lists. We can tag people in Google Contacts.

## Files

One way of organizing files is to use date in file names
