## Environment lecture 2 - 12 Feb 2016

## Dimension of environment
Functions of environment can show one or more of the following aspects

- Resources
  - Nature
  - Man-made
- Technology
  - Equipment
  - Theory
- Waste/Pollution
  - Solid
  - Liquid
  - Gas
  - Physics Pollution
- Human/social
  - Economy
  - Security
  - Politics
  - Recreation
  - etc.

### Resource dimension

1. Yield basic human needs
2. Can be sensed
3. Exists as one of solid, liquid, gas, waves, heat, vibration
4. Can be natural, or man-made

Can be classified to

1. Natural
   - Non exhausible
   - Renewable
   - Exhausible
2. Man made
   - Bio - Physics eg. produce of agricultural, industry, communication, waterworks, energy
   - Socio-ecomical eg. education, law, culture, health
3. Classified for management purposes
   - Physics
   - Biology
   - Human use values
   - Quality of life values

### Technology dimension

Tool, process, or method of application of scientific knowledge for advantage of human.

Level

1. Low technology (Indigenous)
2. Intermediate technology
3. High technology
4. Advanced Technology

Type

1. Natural
  - Forest (soil erosion, climate balance)
  - Soil (plant growth)
  - Animal (forest nutrient cycle)
2. Natural imitation technology
  - City park
  - Hydroponics
  - Buffer distance of roadside
3. Man made technology
  - Machinery & electronics: tools & equipments that generate energy and work
    - Cars
    - Engine
    - Appliances
  - Products: Technology to build products
  - Productive process: Steps, ingredients, method to produce a product

### Pollution/waste

Pollution means the state of environment that has been contaiminated by pollutants, resulting in deterioration of environmental quality.

Waste means refuse, wastewater, polluted air, polluting substances or other hazardous substances which are discarded or originated from pollution sources. The residue of waste also counted as waste.

1. Solid waste
   - Recycle
   - Change to non-polluting solid
   - Sanitary landfill
   - Incineration
2. Liquid waste (also include the substances contained in the liquid)
   - Oxidated pond
   - Activated sludge
3. Gas
   - Dust: use electrostatic precipator
   - Gas: use chemical/gas absorber
   - Soot: use filter
4. Physics
   - Vibration: use hydralics
   - Light: use shades
   - Noise: use ear plug or sound barrier
   - Heat: use cooler
   - Vision: use screen
5. Social pollution
   - Crime
   - Drug
   - Gambling
   - etc.

### Human/social dimension

- Population is function of education
- Public health is function of economy
- Law/regulation is function of politics

## Quiz

1. Sketch flow chart of relationship among waste/pollution treatment process
2. What are the difference between waste & pollution
3. Explain the physics pollution and treatment process of each pollution
4. What are the index for study of human dimension
