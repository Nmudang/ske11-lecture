# Biodiversity

Biodiversity means the variety (number and frequency) between living organisms,
land or sea. The diversity and interactions within species, among species and
in ecosystem is studied.

Biodiversity has 3 levels:

- Genes: eg. skin color
- Species: within same species
- Communities/Ecosystem

Scientists estimated 5-30 million species on earth that are still undiscovered.
1.4 million species of flora, fauna, and microbes are classified.

## Component of Biodiversity

    genetic --> species of the living things --> each type of species
                                                       v
                      physical environment <-----> population
                                              v
                                         Biodiversity
## Benefit of Biodiversity

- Ecosystem function
- Ecosystem service and goods
  - Water cleansing
  - Air cleansing
  - Habitat and breeding area for wildlife
- Aesthetic and cultural benefits

## Threats to Biodiversity

- Extinction and population reductions
  - Pollution
  - Climate change
  - Invasive species

# Environmental impact assessment (EIA)

EIA is to identify impacts arising from proposed development project/activity
/natural phenomena.

## Initial environmental examination (IEE)

IEE is to review environmental integrity of projects to determine whether EIA
should be performed.

The IEE process is:

1. Reviewing of existing information
2. Site observation
3. Site evaluation

## EIA requirements in Thailand

1. EIA by project thresholds
   - eg. reservoir larger than 100 mil. m^3 or larger than 15 km^2
2. EIA by area obligations
   - eg. head water area operations must perform EIA

## Benefits of EIA

- Efficient resource utilization
- Measure project's impacts and to develop a mitigation plan
- To used in development of monitoring plan during construction
- Leads to long term sustainable development
