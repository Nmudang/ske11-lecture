## Getting requirements

1. Interview the user
2. Requirement workshop - drawing mockups, longer than interview
3. Observation - see how the user work
4. Survey - go to the customer site and ask people on how they work
5. Research

## Requirements

- Should be clear, unambiguous
- Unique, don't repeat it several times
- Consistent
- Feasible - possible to do
- Verifiable - system never crash can't really be verified

- If requirements keeps adding it is called requirements creep or feature creep

## Use case guideline

- Don't: cashier needs to enter barcode (this is implementation details)
- Do: POS display item description and price
- Don't: there are many items in the inventory (it's not something the POS do)
- Do: Cashier enters item code
- Don't: The cashier locate the barcode symbol on the item and enter the item's barcode in the systems
